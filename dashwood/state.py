'''State representation and operations

States are an array of 4 uint64s, meaning:
    [0] pieces on board
    [1] inverse of pieces on board
    [2] the next piece to be placed
    [3] bitboard of pieces used
    [4] the last space moved (used for quick win calculations)

[1] is not ~[0]. Rather, it is the inverse of the *pieces* on the board.
The inverse calculation is performed when the piece is ORed onto the
bitboard in move(). Note this means piece 0b0000, while
indistinguishable from empty space on [0], is 0b1111 on [1].

Board space numbering:
    0   1   2   3
    4   5   6   7
    8   9   10  11
    12  13  14  15
